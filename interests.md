## Motorsports

I'm an avid motorsports enthusiast with a particular passion for Formula 1 racing. I follow the F1 season diligently, watching every race and staying up-to-date with team developments, technical innovations, and driver performances.

My interest in motorsports extends beyond spectating – I appreciate the incredible engineering, strategic thinking, and human performance aspects that come together in racing.

## Automotive Engineering & Drifting

One of my most fulfilling projects has been building and modifying a 1999 Mazda Miata for drifting. This hands-on experience has taught me:

- Mechanical engineering principles and automotive systems
- Performance optimization and tuning
- Problem-solving under constraint (budget, time, physical limitations)
- The value of practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge

Taking my Miata to the track for drifting sessions allows me to apply these skills in a dynamic environment while experiencing the joy of controlling a vehicle at the limits of traction.

## Music

I've played the trombone for 12 years, developing both technical skill and musical appreciation. My musical background includes:

- Performance in concert bands and orchestras
- Jazz ensemble experience
- Understanding of music theory and composition
- Appreciation for the discipline required for musical proficiency

Music provides a creative outlet that balances my technical work, teaching me the value of practice, patience, and expressive communication.

## Faith & Ministry

I'm actively involved in campus ministry with Cru, which has been a formative experience in my personal and professional development:

- Leading international trips to North Africa, managing logistics and team dynamics
- Developing cross-cultural communication skills
- Building communities across diverse backgrounds
- Exploring the intersection of faith, ethics, and technology

This work has given me valuable experience in leadership, project management, and interpersonal relationships that complements my technical expertise.

## How My Interests Inform My Work

These diverse interests may seem unrelated to data science at first glance, but they significantly influence my approach to professional challenges:

- **Motorsports** teaches me about performance optimization and systems thinking
- **Automotive projects** build practical problem-solving and engineering mindset
- **Music** develops discipline, attention to detail, and creative expression
- **Ministry work** enhances leadership, cross-cultural awareness, and ethical considerations

I believe that well-rounded individuals bring unique perspectives to technical fields, and my diverse interests help me approach data science problems with creativity, practical wisdom, and human understanding.
