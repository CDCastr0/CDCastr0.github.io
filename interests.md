## Motorsports

I'm an avid motorsports enthusiast with a particular passion for Formula 1 racing. I follow the F1 season diligently, watching every race and staying up-to-date with team developments, technical innovations, and driver performances.

My interest in motorsports extends beyond spectating – I appreciate the incredible engineering, strategic thinking, and human performance aspects that come together in racing.

This passion led me to join SMU's Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) team, where I applied my technical skills in a hands-on racing environment.

## Automotive Engineering & Drifting

One of my most fulfilling projects has been building and modifying a 1999 Mazda Miata for drifting. This hands-on experience has taught me:

- Mechanical engineering principles and automotive systems
- Performance optimization and tuning
- Problem-solving under constraint (budget, time, physical limitations)
- The value of practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge

Taking my Miata to the track for drifting sessions allows me to apply these skills in a dynamic environment while experiencing the joy of controlling a vehicle at the limits of traction.

## Music & Performance

I've played the trombone for 12 years, developing both technical skill and musical appreciation. My musical background includes:

- Performance in the SMU Mustang Band from Fall 2019 to May 2023
- Leadership position in the band during 2022-2023
- Experience in concert bands and orchestras
- Jazz ensemble experience
- Understanding of music theory and composition
- Appreciation for the discipline required for musical proficiency

Music provides a creative outlet that balances my technical work, teaching me the value of practice, patience, and expressive communication. Participating in Mustang Band also connected me with the broader campus community and taught me to balance a demanding rehearsal and performance schedule with academic responsibilities.

## Faith & Ministry

I'm actively involved in campus ministry with Cru, which has been a formative experience in my personal and professional development:

- Leading international trips to North Africa, managing logistics and team dynamics
- Serving on the Cru leadership team (Spring 2022 - May 2023)
- Transitioning to volunteer staff (August 2023 - May 2024) and then part-time staff (August 2024 - Present)
- Developing cross-cultural communication skills
- Building communities across diverse backgrounds
- Exploring the intersection of faith, ethics, and technology

This work has given me valuable experience in leadership, project management, and interpersonal relationships that complements my technical expertise.

## Campus & Community Engagement

Beyond my core interests, I value being an active member of campus and community organizations:

### Theta Tau Engineering Fraternity
As a member from Spring 2020 to May 2023, I held several leadership positions including Risk Management Chair, Community Service Chair, and Rush Chair. These roles taught me organizational leadership, event planning, and community building.

### SMU Mustang Mavericks
I participated in this student spirit organization from Spring 2020 onward, supporting athletic events and fostering school spirit across campus.

## How My Interests Inform My Work

These diverse interests may seem unrelated to data science at first glance, but they significantly influence my approach to professional challenges:

- **Motorsports & FSAE** teaches me about performance optimization and systems thinking
- **Automotive projects** build practical problem-solving and engineering mindset
- **Music & band participation** develops discipline, teamwork, and attention to detail
- **Ministry work** enhances leadership, cross-cultural awareness, and ethical considerations
- **Campus involvement** strengthens my ability to collaborate with diverse teams

I believe that well-rounded individuals bring unique perspectives to technical fields, and my diverse interests help me approach data science problems with creativity, practical wisdom, and human understanding.
