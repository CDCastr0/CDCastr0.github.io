## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an application to overcome language barriers using AI technology. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, I developed a tool that provides realistic-voice translations of YouTube videos, making content accessible across different languages.

## BabelBridge Platform
**[View Complete BabelBridge Technical Documentation](BabelBridge.md)**

BabelBridge is the comprehensive AI-powered video translation platform developed as part of this project. It automates the process of translating video content across multiple languages, leveraging OpenAI's speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech capabilities.

### Key Features
- **Multi-language Support**: Translates content into 20+ languages including Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Japanese, and more
- **High-Quality Voice Generation**: Natural-sounding speech using OpenAI's TTS technology
- **YouTube Integration**: Direct processing of YouTube videos by URL
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: WebSocket-based updates on translation progress

For detailed technical implementation, architecture, and full capabilities, [view the complete BabelBridge documentation](BabelBridge.md).

## Key Features
- **Real-time Translation**: Converts spoken language in videos to text and translates it to target languages
- **Natural Voice Synthesis**: Generates realistic-sounding voice outputs that maintain the tone and emotion of the original speaker
- **Multi-platform Support**: Works across different devices and operating systems
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple design that makes translation accessible to users of all technical backgrounds

## Technologies Used
- **AI Development Tools**: Cursor, ChatGPT, other MCP (Multiple Context Protocol) tools
- **Speech Recognition**: Advanced ML models for accurate speech-to-text conversion
- **Natural Language Processing**: State-of-the-art translation algorithms
- **Voice Synthesis**: Neural network models for generating natural-sounding speech
