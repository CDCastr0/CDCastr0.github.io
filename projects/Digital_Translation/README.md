## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an application to overcome language barriers using AI technology. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, I developed a tool that provides realistic-voice translations of YouTube videos, making content accessible across different languages.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Translation**: Converts spoken language in videos to text and translates it to target languages
- **Natural Voice Synthesis**: Generates realistic-sounding voice outputs that maintain the tone and emotion of the original speaker
- **Multi-platform Support**: Works across different devices and operating systems
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple design that makes translation accessible to users of all technical backgrounds

## Technologies Used
- **AI Development Tools**: Cursor, ChatGPT, other MCP (Multi-agent Collaboration Platform) tools
- **Speech Recognition**: Advanced ML models for accurate speech-to-text conversion
- **Natural Language Processing**: State-of-the-art translation algorithms
- **Voice Synthesis**: Neural network models for generating natural-sounding speech

## Impact and Applications
- **Educational Access**: Makes educational content available across language barriers
- **Global Communication**: Facilitates international dialogue and understanding
- **Content Creation**: Enables creators to reach wider, more diverse audiences
- **Accessibility**: Improves access to information for non-native speakers

## Future Development
- Expanding language support to include more rare and indigenous languages
- Improving real-time processing speed
- Adding context-aware translations for specialized terminology
- Developing offline capabilities for areas with limited internet access
