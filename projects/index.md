## Available Projects

### [Digital Translation in the AI Era](https://cdcastr0.github.io/projects/Digital_Translation)
This project focuses on building an application to overcome language barriers using AI technology. By leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, I developed a tool that provides realistic-voice translations of YouTube videos, making content accessible across different languages.

### [Beer Case Study](https://cdcastr0.github.io/projects/Beers_Case_Study)
Analyzed trends in market data to propose to a hypothetical client. Used foundational analytical methods in R to suggest a strategy to reach underserved niches by identifying the relationship between IBU and ABV, as well as identifying areas with the most craft beer culture.

### [Ames, Iowa Housing Project](https://cdcastr0.github.io/projects/Ames_Housing_Price_Prediction)
Used both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression to propose a solution to the Kaggle Ames Housing Price Prediction competition. My partner Christy and I found models that predicted price via SLR and MLR as well as built an RShiny App to display home prices based on neighborhood.
