I blend technical data science expertise with insights from my background in religious studies to approach problems in a unique way. My interdisciplinary perspective helps me build solutions that consider both technical requirements and human dimensions.

Currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Science at Southern Methodist University while working as a Data Scientist at NIT Consulting, I focus on creating data-driven solutions for real-world challenges.
