### Projects
**Beer Case Study**
   
Analyzed trends in market data to propose to a hypothetical client. Used foundational analytical methods in R to suggest a strategy to reach underserved niches by identifying the relationship between IBU and ABV, as well as identifying areas with the most craft beer culture.
 
**Ames, Iowa Housing Project**
   
Used both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression to propose a solution to the Kaggle Ames Housing Price Prediction competition. My partner Christy and I found models that predicted price via SLR and MLR as well as built an RShiny App to display home prices based on neighborhood.
