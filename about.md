# About Me

[← Back to Home](https://cdcastr0.github.io)

## My Background

I'm a data scientist with a unique interdisciplinary background that combines technical expertise with humanistic understanding. With a Bachelor's in Religious Studies and currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Southern Methodist University, I approach technical challenges with a holistic perspective that considers both the technical requirements and their human implications.

My journey into data science began with a fascination for how technology shapes society and culture. This interest, combined with my analytical mindset, led me to pursue a career where I could use data to solve real-world problems while maintaining awareness of the broader social context.

## Professional Journey

As a Data Scientist at NIT Consulting, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects ranging from employee attrition analysis to real estate market prediction. Each project has reinforced my belief in the power of data-driven decision making while also highlighting the importance of understanding the human factors that influence these decisions.

My experience in IT support has given me a foundation in technical troubleshooting and customer service, while my leadership roles in campus ministry and Formula SAE have developed my project management and team coordination skills.

## My Approach

I believe in approaching data science challenges with:

- **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: Drawing connections between technical knowledge and humanities insights
- **Ethical Consideration**: Ensuring responsible development and application of technology
- **Practical Innovation**: Focusing on solutions that address real-world needs
- **Clear Communication**: Translating technical concepts into accessible language

## Beyond the Code

Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about motorsports, particularly Formula 1, and have hands-on experience building and drifting a 1999 Mazda Miata. I've played trombone for 12 years, which has taught me discipline and the value of practice. I'm also actively involved in campus ministry with Cru, which has given me opportunities to develop cross-cultural communication skills and leadership experience.

These diverse interests inform my perspective as a data scientist, reminding me that behind every dataset are real people with complex lives and motivations.
