# About Me

[← Back to Home](https://cdcastr0.github.io)

## My Background

I'm a data scientist with a unique interdisciplinary background that combines technical expertise with humanistic understanding. With a Bachelor's in Religious Studies and currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Southern Methodist University, I approach technical challenges with a holistic perspective that considers both the technical requirements and their human implications.

My journey into data science began with a fascination for how technology shapes society and culture. This interest, combined with my analytical mindset, led me to pursue a career where I could use data to solve real-world problems while maintaining awareness of the broader social context.

While my formal education in Religious Studies might seem an unusual path to data science, this background has proven invaluable in understanding human behavior, cultural contexts, and ethical implications of technology—skills that are increasingly recognized as essential in the responsible development of AI and data solutions.

## Professional Journey

As a Data Scientist at NIT Consulting, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects ranging from employee attrition analysis to real estate market prediction. Each project has reinforced my belief in the power of data-driven decision making while also highlighting the importance of understanding the human factors that influence these decisions.

My experience in IT support has given me a foundation in technical troubleshooting and customer service, while my leadership roles in campus ministry and Formula SAE have developed my project management and team coordination skills.

## Leadership Experience

Throughout my academic and professional career, I've embraced leadership opportunities that have shaped my approach to teamwork and project management:

- **Electrical Team Lead** for SMU's Formula SAE team, where I led the design and implementation of electrical systems for racing vehicles
- **Team Lead** at SMU's IT Help Desk, managing student workers and coordinating support operations
- **Leadership positions** in Theta Tau Engineering Fraternity, including Risk Management Chair and Community Service Chair
- **Leadership role** in SMU Mustang Band during 2022-2023
- **Campus ministry leadership** with Cru, including organizing and leading international trips

These experiences have taught me how to collaborate effectively with diverse teams, manage complex projects, and balance technical requirements with human considerations.

## My Approach

I believe in approaching data science challenges with:

- **Interdisciplinary Thinking**: Drawing connections between technical knowledge and humanities insights
- **Ethical Consideration**: Ensuring responsible development and application of technology
- **Practical Innovation**: Focusing on solutions that address real-world needs
- **Clear Communication**: Translating technical concepts into accessible language
- **Cultural Awareness**: Recognizing how diverse perspectives enhance problem-solving
- **Systems Thinking**: Understanding how components interact within larger contexts

## Beyond the Code

Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about motorsports, particularly Formula 1, and have hands-on experience building and drifting a 1999 Mazda Miata. I've played trombone for 12 years, including performing with the SMU Mustang Band. I'm also actively involved in campus ministry with Cru, which has given me opportunities to develop cross-cultural communication skills and leadership experience.

These diverse interests inform my perspective as a data scientist, reminding me that behind every dataset are real people with complex lives and motivations. The blend of technical skills, humanities background, and varied personal interests allows me to bring a unique perspective to data science challenges.
